## Welcome!!

Welcome to IEP!! We are happy to have you with us this semester and canâ€™t wait to know you better. We know that doing Erasmus can be a challenging part of our Academic life and because of that the AAIEP has prepared a survival guide for the Erasmus students that stay with us throughout the years. You can access the Lisbon Guide **here**

# ESN Lisbon

Thinking about our exchange students, the AAIEP has created a partnership with ESN Lisbon (Erasmus Student Network) to better attend all the needs and questions that you might have. Stay tuned for more. Check out the ESN Lisbon Website **Here**
